We woke up crying at what we'd said
We found ourselves staring into the dead
I told you stories you already knew
And I shed anger that was blocking my view

So we said it was over
We said it was time to go
Then you fooled me with your silence
And we felt that boat sinking

Would it be right, would it be smart
Would it be a help to you or at least a start, at least a start
Would it be wise, would it need heart

It's not the first time I've sunk this low
It won't be the last time you'll want me to go
Surrender my promise not to let you down
Remember the world we made spinning around and around and around

Would it be right, would it be smart
Would it be a help to you or at least a start, at least a start
Would it be wise, would it need heart
Would it take that long to heal or would it fall apart, and fall apart
Would it be right, would it be smart
Would it be a help to you or at least a start, at least a start
Would it be wise, would it need heart
