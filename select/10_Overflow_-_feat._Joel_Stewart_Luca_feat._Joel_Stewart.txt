It's colder out here
Just waiting around here
Ohh, halve you ever felt this way?
I've been feeling this
Since the light shined on that day

Take time it heals my friend
Wait for this to end
Cause it's alright to be afraid
Fall, I'm never lonely
If you're there to hold me darling,
You're all I'll ever know

I fall and wait
Hiding on the overflow
I fall and wait
Hiding on the overflow
I fall and wait
Hiding on the overflow
I fall and wait
Hiding on the overflow
