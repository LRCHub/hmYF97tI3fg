Some say the world gets smaller the more that you know
Hearts grow bitter the older we grow
We're all just dust in the wind, we can't comprehend
The ways of this world of this I'm sure

I'm running on empty, but got a ways to go now
And it's always the same thing, I won't let you down now
When I'm running on empty, you're more than enough
More than enough to make me feel complete
More than enough, more than enough to make me feel complete
You are my overflow, you are my overflow

I see the slope getting steeper the higher we go
The further along, the less it shows
I walk this road less traveled in search to find
Hopes and fears we've left behind

I'm running on empty but got a ways to go now
And it's always the same thing, I won't let you down now
When I'm running on empty, you're more than enough
More than enough to make me feel complete
More than enough, more than enough to make me feel complete
You are my overflow, you are my overflow
